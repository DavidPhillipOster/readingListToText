# readingListToText
An Objective C app to convert a macOS Safari Reading list to JSON

Safari Reading List appears to live in: ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist

But that Safari directory is so heavily protected that I couldn't see the files inside it, not even sudo'ing in from Terminal.

This is a simple Objective C app to convert a macOS Safari Reading list to JSON

Copy from the result window and paste somewhere else.
